      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>
        There are many different methods you can utilize for successfully
        kicking off an introduction to both draw in a reader's attention 
        and prepare them for the kinds of arbitrary personal details and over-simplifying 
        self-reflections common to these forms, but the only method I'm apparently equipped to 
        utilize is this drawn-out, uncomfortably meta one that's kinda fails to say anything 
        meaningful directly and yet says everything you need to know about who's writing it. 
        My pedantic writing choices aside, I'm just some guy that fell into a full-stack web
        developer job at a solar company essentially by accident whose trying to turn that 
        into a successful software development career.

      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>
        I spent my formative years in Studio City, CA / Sherman Oaks, CA playing with legos and catching Pokemon;
        after the recession, my family and I moved to the San Fernando Valley where I went to high school.
      </p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>
        Mostly video games and brooding
      </p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>
        I would love to develop video games. While I haven't made any games myself, 
        I enjoying thinking about the problems game designers have to struggle with 
        and the methods that games utilize to convey information to the player. The 
        main reason this dream job is purely a dream for me is because, as far as I can tell,
        climate change is too big of a problem to ignore and is not the kind of 
        problem I can significantly help address as a game developer. 
      </p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>
        I'm living near Santa Monica, CA.
      </p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>
        The internet is one of the most grossly impactful technologies in the world, 
        if not THE most grossly impactful technology in the world. The liquidity of 
        information this technology enables can make a significant difference in how an
        organization makes decisions and, in turn, finds success toward its goals.
        When web development is done right, you can produce some of the most valuable tools in an 
        organizations arsenal, and I want to produce some of those valuable tools 
        for people doing the real work of transitionin our planet to a more sustainable future.
